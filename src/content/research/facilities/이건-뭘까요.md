Electrical transport measurement under various conditions is the main tool of my research. Simple experimental method where current (voltage) is applied through the sample and voltage (current) is measured is conducted to get the information of resistance based on Ohm’s law. Even though the basic concept and method are very simple, transport measurement is very powerful tool to explore the properties of materials from metal to insulator with optimized electrode configuration and under various experimental environments.
