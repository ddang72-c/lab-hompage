  title: About Laboratory of Electronic Transport in Solids
  text: Electrical transport measurement under various conditions is the main tool
    of my research. Simple experimental method where current (voltage) is
    applied through the sample and voltage (current) is measured is conducted to
    get the information of resistance based on Ohm’s law. Even though the basic
    concept and method are very simple, transport measurement is very powerful
    tool to explore the properties of materials from metal to insulator with
    optimized electrode configuration and under various experimental
    environments.
